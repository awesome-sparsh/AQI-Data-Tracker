# AQI-Data-Tracker
This is a small passion project built by myself, an AQI sensor, PM 10 & PM2.5 sensor hooked up to a IOT device, the NodeMcu ESP 8266.
the sensors collect data regarding air quality and via Wireless fidelity ping the data to a server after every consecutive minute.
A webpage then makes an API request to the server thus fetching the data and displaying it on this user interface.
